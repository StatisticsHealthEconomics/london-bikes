# Predicting the number of bike shares in London 
## BSc project - 30 credits
### Difficulty: **Low/medium difficulty** :grimacing: or :grimacing: :grimacing:, depending on specs

**Description**: We'll use data made publicly available from Transport for London (TFL; source of data: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)) to estimate the relationship between the number of bikes shared around the London network on a given day, depending on weather and other characteristics to predict the capacity needed to satisfy demand at any given point. Requires `R` and familiarity with non-linear regression models. Students are encouraged to work with [`Rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) to develop their dissertation.
